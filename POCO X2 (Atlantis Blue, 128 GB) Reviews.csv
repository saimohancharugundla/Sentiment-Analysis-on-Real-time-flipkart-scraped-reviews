5,Worth every penny,"This is the  new Phone I'm using after 4 years. My old Phone was Redmi note 4. Poco X2 was awesome. Meet my expectations. Loved it. Overall  good performance. A little bit disappointed with the night camara performance. Otherwise it's a superb android phone. Display 120 RR really works well.     "" Loved this like my note 4""Note: Guys no words to say about back camera performance. Ooooowsammm!!! Adding photos with out any editsREAD MORE"
5,Worth every penny,Since i want camera phone and this is the best camera phone. 120 hz refreshing rate i dont whether it works or not. But overall phone is very good. I love camera. 6 ram with 128 gb is best because 64 mp camera pic occupied 31 mb per photo and internal memory will get full very fast. Hybrid sim slot is disappointed. Audio quality in bluetooth headset is super. Charging is very faster than you expectations. Good deal for game lover. Very confused between Realme 6 pro vs Poco X2 but finally deci...READ MORE
4,Nice product,"Pros-I can surely say that it is really value for money phone....if u are looking for awesome camera, battery and performance just go for it without any doubt also charger is enough fast.i also used many phone with IPS LCD display but this one i can say one word.....great.Cons- i must say that it is little heavier side and also no led notification light enabled by developers while it has that i hope they will fix it next ota update.READ MORE"
5,Simply awesome,Sony IMX 686 sensor is really flagship level camera sensor. Captured pitch dark night sky with google camera night sight (Astrophotography) mode and got very impressive results which can easily beat a DSLR camera. The stars captured in image were so fade in reality that they were not even visible to naked eyes. Snapdragon 730G SOC is powerful enough to handle the most graphics intensive operations. Played few games capable of achieving 120 fps and they were easily handled by this processor....READ MORE

5,Awesome,"Beast Unleashed!!!Update - Battery backup tested at 60Hz. Screenshots attached for fool proof evidence.Those of you who said that battery drains faster than other phones you might not be knowing that the phone by default runs at 120Hz refresh rate which no other phone in the indian market offers, it makes your screen smoother than any other phone at the budget segment but it has a price to pay, the battery drains out. I would say the phone at 60hz isn't as fast as 120hz but it's faster than...READ MORE"

5,Worth every penny,"I ordered my phone on 20th of March but unfortunately due to lockdown I recieved it on 6th of may. But, believe you me all, it was worth the wait. This phone is a grab on in it's price segment. From design to features, this phone is complete charmer, I personally loved the screen ratio, matrix purple colour and the dual notch (especially when they are separated as two). 120hz refresh rate is makkhan though it drains battery.

5,Must buy!,"I did alot of research on phones between 15k and 20k, and found POCO X2 best in all segments. After that i decided to buy it, i must say it was the best decision. This phone is best under 20k no doubts. Amazing performance and awesome cameras, yeah it's a little big but i got used to it in 2-3 days. And yeah 120hz display is literally gorgeous.It has low rating in battery but after new update you get a full day battery! DON'T THINK TOO MUCH GO FOR IT!READ MORE"
5,Value-for-money,"I've been using this device for over a week now. Here's how I feel about it:The display is amazing. 120hz is as smooth as it could be, it's no gimmick, you'll know when you use it. There is no lag or stutter either. The battery issue has been resolved, I am a hardcore gamer, the phone can easily handle more than 4 hours of continuous gaming. I only have to charge my device twice a day despite playing games most of times. Moreover, there is no major heating issue whatsoever. You may find the...READ MORE"

5,Perfect product!,"Best camera at this range...Screen quality is very good...Performance is very good...There is no battery drainage problem,but if you use 120Hz refresh rate of display,then it will drain faster,and you will get 3-4 hours less battery backup...with moderate usage and with low gaming at 120Hz it gives backup of the full day...and with 60Hz it gives 1.5 to 2 days backup...No lags at all...Screen visibility is very good in sunlight...Charging is super fast.Battery charges fully in 1 hour......READ MORE"
5,Best in the market!,"Honestly saying Excellent value for money phone. If you are considering Redmi note 9 pro max, real me 6 pro or XT, Samsung M31 as competators and looking for best phone under 20000 then no doubt blindly go for POCO. Don't compromise for refresh rate,120 Hz really matters alot, Poco has nearly same brightness as amoled screen so it can be compromised. Best camera, Sony IMX sensor makes it unreal.

5,Just wow!,Awesome camera and performance is really appreciable.Initially there was a lot of heating issue while playing heavy games like pubg mobile and I thought there is definitely some problem with the liquid cooling system but gradually after 2-3 days of heavy usage the heating problem had gone and it seems the liquid cooling tech is doing it's job fine now. The battery performance is good enough but for more battery efficiency the 60 hz refresh rate mode can be used but there is no issue with bat...READ MORE
5,Best possible package at this price ,"A great deal at this price. Bought it after reading a lot of reviews. I was a little afraid regarding the battery, but believe me, it is really good. The main cons of this phone are speaker and haptics. They used very cheap components for them. Camera is great on spec sheet, but not that great in reality when compared to Oneplus 7 especially when both share similar setup and sensors. It could be because of the processor. But don't take it in a different way, the camera still beats all the oth...READ MORE"
5,Good choice,I have been using this mobile for last 2 days and  now I am writing a honest review about this mobile. This phone is very good for playing games though it heats up a bit even putting on 60 hz refresh rate.This phone heats up on normal usage and drains lot of battery when put on 120 hz refresh rate. But on putting 60hz refresh rate it heats up only a bit even on long time gaming.Plzz don't buy this miui 11 is full of glitches buy realme x2READ MORE

About the battery part, it gives me 9 hours of SOT in 60hz and 7 hours @120hz which is good I guess, providing the fast charger which charges within 1 hour 5-6 minuites at cool weather and and takes over 1.30 hour if It is in hot and humid weather.

And if you're still worried about the battery life I will say that if you're a decent user and office goer who's not having time for games and all those stuff's then the battery will easily give you few hour more than a day back up .

3,Delightful,According to me everything is fine in this phone but I am facing some phone charging issues. I don't know why it is taking a lot of time to charge even i charge it with the original fast charger by poco. One day I found that my poco x2 charges from 5%-50% in 1.30 hrs!!! And the compamy claims that it gets fully charged from 0%-100% in just 68 min. I'm gonna check it for 2 more days if it is going like this I'm gonna return this phone as it is in the return policy.READ MORE
3,Excellent,Best mobile with that price and 120fps refresh rate for this price is really fantastic. Best for gaming too. But don't use the 120fps all the time it may effect the battery life. Remaining all aspects it is good. MiUI 11 is good and I never noticed any ads in this interface it was betterREAD MORE
3,Good quality product,"The phone is really really awesome for it's price especially the camera does wonders with gcam. The battery drain is more when on 120 hz but still I get 5 hours screen on time which is good. Also the processor is pretty good for everything considering the price. The only things missing are 1. Amoled panel but 120hz can compensate for it.2. Good night vision optimization3. Better macro camera, it should have been of 5 MP atleast to get good shots.READ MORE"
5,Wonderful,Phone is too good in this price range. No other phone can beat Poco X2 under 20k segment. Performance and camera is best. Sony IMX686 camera sensor gives flagship level photos in daylight and low-light. With GCam it can outperform OnePlus 7T in rear camera performance. Battery performance is also good. Just one negetive thing i have noticed that it heats up alot when i shoot videos and when taking alot of photos. Else everything is good.READ MORE

5,Fair,It's a good phone if you have a charger handy at all times. Battery performance is abysmal and it gives a screen on time of around 5 hours on normal usage. It's not a full day phone. U would need to charge it atleast once during the day. Other than that. Heating issue is a major problem it heats up even with the simplest of the tasks. I don't know why they're marketing as a liquid cooled phone. Coz it doesn't feels like it. If you can live with a bad battery life and heating. It's a good ph...READ MORE

The display is the best in its price class, while the battery is good, it's not the greatest but it's not really a deal breaker. The cameras are pretty good as well, especially for macro shots and 960fps slo-mo. The only thing I didn't like about the phone is the bloated Mi Apps, and once you install the Lawnchair Launcher, it's a really goo...READ MORE"

Camera is aggresive with the processing, if you zoom in, you can find the difference in the images, it looks as somebody painted on the image. Heating is there when doing aggresive tasks like gaming, yet to check it more to see whether it becomes unbearable.Charging is the only superfast th...READ MORE"

5,Nice product,"It's a good all round phone. Display is good once you start using the 120 Hz display, you'd feel like you're using flagship device. Camera is just average (still best under 20k) preferably use GCam to improve the camera performance because the stock camera just over sharpens the images (hope Poco fixes software processing) and they don't look good. Battery life is good but not as expected from a 4500 mAh battery. PUBG is playable at smooth ultra, the overall gameplay is stable. Liquid cooling...READ MORE"

At the time of writing this review, UI in this device is not polished and the launcher crashes sometimes. Night mode in the camera is really bad. Also, macro shots are not good enough to consider. You may end up touching fingerprint sensor unintentionally because it is positioned in such a way. The main thing is, battery life is really bad.

There is a little bit of hitting issue i noticed when gaming. 3rd is there is too much of unnecessary promotional apps. Which u can't uninstall.

5,Great product,I have been using this phone for a week and here is what I felt1. The phone feels super fast because of the 120 hz rate but 60 hz is not half bad. But even in 120 hz I felt some hiccups here and there but that is totally untraceable and fine2.camera is decent indoors but is a beast outdoors especially those AI powered shots were too good. The same is for selfie camera3. Gaming experience is mixed for me... Some times the experience is flawless but sometimes it hangs when the phone heats bu...READ MORE

4,Must buy!,"First of all, worth every penny spent on it. Good performance, great display, good build and camera. The thing that most catches your eye is the display, really vibrant and almost comparable to oled at this price point. 120hz doesn't make much of a difference apart from games and system interface.
