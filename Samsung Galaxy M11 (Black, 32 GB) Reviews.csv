4,Worth the money,"Multimedia  experience on this device is really good with punch hole display and Dolby audio sound. Battery backup is good with fast charging & type c cable. Performance with Snapdragon chipset is above average with day to day tasks  done easily. Heavy gaming has not been  meant for this device, however  we can play  games in smooth or medium mode.READ MORE"
5,Just wow!,Very nice phone. rear camera is awesome but front camera needs improvement.I loved it personally. Thank you FlipkartREAD MORE
4,Worth the money,"So it's a good device for light users. I bought it for my mom and she is very happy with it.As we go in detail,Pros :1. Great battery life and decent fast charging.2. Excellent display in this price range.3. Sound is above average.4. Build quality and design is fantastic.5. Very fast and accurate finger print sensor.6. Triple card slot (2 sim and dedicated sd card)Cons : 1. Average performance (could have been better)     On light gaming - no issues faced.2. Selfie camera lacks Q...READ MORE"
3,Just okay,"The phone performs reasonably excellent for mild users. But if you're are a multi-tasking, heavy user of high end apps the phone is not at all recommendable to them.Points to consider before buying:1.The phone has maximum body made out of plastic. The phone still looks good. The Samsung logo is not clearly visible.2. The phone's battery is reliable. Once completely charged to 100% it can easily last a day. Even though the phone has huge battery capacity and adds few extra grams of weight,...READ MORE"
4,Really Nice,The actual day to day performance is better than expected. Unfortunately it is overpriced as hell but sadly if you are looking for a non Chinese phone under 12k it is your best bet.A few notable observations about the phone:(I have been using a Redmi Note 4 prior to this so my observations will be based on compared to that)1) Screen (4/5)- It's honestly a lot more better than expected.  I was not very excited about downgrading from a 1080p screen to 720p one but damn if this panel ain't ...READ MORE
5,Terrific purchase,"Worth every penny. Gives great performance. The battery charges quickly and last quite long. Great display. The touch panel works so smooth. The only con side is the storage, as some brands give RAM ROM of 4GB/64GB at this price.READ MORE"
5,Super!,"Good phone for family members like elder persons. Samsung always rocks by its display. On screen punch hole camera have added  attractive looks. Camera is good. Apart from the samsung brand loving customer, others customer before buying this product might get  shocked to see the price of this product in respect of features. They surely going to thought that in this price range I can buy other phone like Vivo Oppo Realme Redmi. I have also thought the same. But believe me after purchasing the ...READ MORE"
4,Very Good,"My honest rating would be 3.5 out of 5. Camera and display quality is beloe the bar. Battery backup is amazing. PUBG is running fine without lag üòÇ. Android 10 and user friendly interface, elegant look makes it worth the money. Expecting a better MADE IN INDIA at this range of money would be injustice.READ MORE"
5,Best in the market!,I was looking for a non Chinese budget smart phone for my mother to be able to have daily video calls with her and this mobile fits the bill perfectly. She is happy using it and video image is crisp with clear sound. A big hats off to the Flipkart delivery service for making sure the order reached on time without any damage during this difficult times. Thank you Flipkart and Ekart for enabling me to meet my mother from abroad on a daily basis! üôèüèºREAD MORE
5,Brilliant,It quite an awesome product but it's quite overpriced. If you like you can go for other company like Realme which gives much better specs in the same price range. But the delivery service of Flipkart was very satisfying. I got the product on next day of order. Thank you Flipkart üòòüòò.READ MORE

3,Just okay,"A good looking phone that's meant for light use cases. I purchased this phone for my mom and her main use case is YouTube streaming and instant messaging. This phone is in no way capable of gaming nor is it intended for power users.Pros: * The main reason for picking this phone was the hole punch display. It looks contemporary and stylish. I find notched displays unappealing. Also, I prefer Samsung over the cheaper Chinese alternatives.* On paper, the display seems poor. It's a TFT pane...READ MORE"

3,Fair,This phone is not at all made for camera centric users the front camera is of no use but its overall a great device for daily usage with a great battery life and good performance with the SNAPDRAGON 450 Soc.The camera struggles a lot just because of the absence of the gyroscope sensor also the display is a TFT panel so the color reproduction is not good as the colours are not punchy.But if u are gifting it to your parents it will be great device in this budget segment.READ MORE
